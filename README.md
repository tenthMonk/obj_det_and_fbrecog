# obj_det_and_fbrecog
Object recognition using tensorflow and webcam. I'm trying to incorporate face recognition of people with python-fbrecog.

# Application
I'm planning to extend the project such that it can be used as a smart assistant for the blind people.
To recogonize the objects infront of them and identify a person if they happen to be facebook friend of his or hers. 
(I know  that blind people might not use facebook so a guardian might have to provide the key for the fb account access.)
